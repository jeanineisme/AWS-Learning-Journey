# EC2: Launching an Instance

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to launch and manage an EC2 instance using AWS. In this prjoect I launched, connected to, use a Linux instance, and then terminate the instance.

## Steps

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**
   - In this case, I do not have any users with administrative access so I have created one to be able to complete this project without using my root user account.
   - To create the IAM user, I navigated to the IAM service and selected *Users* on the right-hand side under the *Access management* dropdown of the Dashboard.
   - From here I pressed the orange *Create user* button on the top-right, then gave set a user name for my new IAM user. 
   - I decided to allow this user to have AWS Management Consol Access, then proceeded to creat the IAM user and set a custom password. 
   - In the permissions step, the only policies I attached were the permissions related to giving administrator access. 
   - After creating my new IAM user, I signed out of my root account and signed into the new IAM user account with admin access. 

2. **Create a Key Pair**
   - Since a Linux instance has no password, I created a key pair to log into my instance securely.


**Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**
   - Select an AMI that suits your requirements (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).

3. **Choose an Instance Type**
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier eligibility).

4. **Configure Instance Details**
   - Configure network settings, IAM role, and user data (if needed).

5. **Add Storage**
   - Specify the size and type of the storage volume.

6. **Add Tags**
   - Add tags to help identify your instance.

7. **Configure Security Group**
   - Create a new security group or select an existing one.
   - Configure rules to allow SSH access (port 22).

8. **Review and Launch**
   - Review all settings and launch the instance.
   - Select an existing key pair or create a new one to access the instance.

9. **Connect to Your Instance**
   - Use SSH to connect to the instance using the key pair.
