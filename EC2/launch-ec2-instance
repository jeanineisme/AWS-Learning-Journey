# EC2: Launching an Instance

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to launch and manage an EC2 instance using AWS. In this prjoect I launched, connected to, use a Linux instance, and then terminate the instance.

## Steps

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**
   - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.

   - Select an AMI that suits your requirements (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).

3. **Choose an Instance Type**
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier eligibility).

4. **Configure Instance Details**
   - Configure network settings, IAM role, and user data (if needed).

5. **Add Storage**
   - Specify the size and type of the storage volume.

6. **Add Tags**
   - Add tags to help identify your instance.

7. **Configure Security Group**
   - Create a new security group or select an existing one.
   - Configure rules to allow SSH access (port 22).

8. **Review and Launch**
   - Review all settings and launch the instance.
   - Select an existing key pair or create a new one to access the instance.

9. **Connect to Your Instance**
   - Use SSH to connect to the instance using the key pair.
